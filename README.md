# Twitter Data Analysis using Python
==================================

# Overview
--------
This project demonstrates the use of Python for data science tasks by analyzing a dataset containing various Twitter metrics. The project focuses on writing custom Python functions, handling data inconsistencies, and leveraging iterators, list comprehensions, and lambda functions to extract insights from Twitter data.

# Objectives
----------
- Practice Python function writing, including default arguments, multiple returns, and error handling.
- Use iterators and list comprehensions for efficient data processing.
- Apply lambda functions and demonstrate variable scoping.
- Analyze trending keywords and summarize key findings.

# Dataset
-------
Assumed columns in the Twitter dataset:
- Tweet Date
- Tweet Text
- Retweet Count
- Like Count
- Hashtags

# Requirements
------------
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- (Optional) matplotlib for data visualization

# Key Tasks and Methods
---------------------
1. Data Importing and Cleaning
   - Import the Twitter dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Handle missing data, outliers, and string paddings to ensure data quality.

2. Function Writing
   - Write a function to filter tweets based on a given keyword.
   - Write another function to calculate average retweet and like counts within a specified date range.
   - Implement default arguments, multiple return values, and error handling.

3. Iterators and List Comprehensions
   - Create an iterator to traverse tweet texts and count occurrences of a keyword.
   - Use a list comprehension to extract hashtags from tweet texts.

4. Lambda Functions and Scoping
   - Use a lambda function to extract the year from the tweet date.
   - Demonstrate variable scoping with global and local variables.

5. Case Study and Analysis
   - Combine the above techniques to analyze trending keywords over different time periods.
   - Summarize findings in a concise report.

# Deliverables
------------
- A Python script (.py) containing all code, functions, and comments.
- A summary report detailing the analysis process and key insights.

# Evaluation Criteria
-------------------
- Code Quality: Well-organized, readable, and documented code.
- Function Writing: Effective use of custom functions and error handling.
- Iterators & List Comprehensions: Efficient and correct implementations.
- Case Study: Insightful and well-executed final analysis.

# How to Use
----------
1. Ensure Python 3.x and required libraries (pandas, matplotlib) are installed.
2. Place the Twitter dataset CSV file in the project directory.
3. Run the provided Python script to perform the analysis.
4. Review the generated report for insights and findings.

# Summary
-------
This project highlights essential Python skills for data science, including data cleaning, function writing, and advanced data processing techniques. By analyzing Twitter data, the project demonstrates how to extract actionable insights and trends from real-world social media datasets.
